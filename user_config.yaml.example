# Auto-Trader User Configuration Template
# Copy this file to user_config.yaml and customize for your trading preferences
# 
# This file contains trader-specific defaults and preferences that enhance 
# the system configuration without changing core behavior.
#
# SECURITY NOTE: This file does not contain secrets - those belong in .env

# Advanced Configuration (Optional)

# These fields are maintained for backward compatibility with older versions.
# New users should use the fields above instead.

# DEPRECATED: Use account_value instead
# default_account_value: 10000.00

# DEPRECATED: Use default_entry_function instead  
# default_execution_functions:
#   long: "close_above"
#   short: "close_below"

# Configuration Notes:
# ===================
# 
# 1. Position Sizing: The account_value is used to calculate position sizes
#    based on your risk_category and the specific trade plan parameters.
#
# 2. Risk Categories:
#    - small: Conservative position sizing (1-2% account risk)
#    - normal: Balanced position sizing (2-3% account risk)  
#    - large: Aggressive position sizing (3-5% account risk)
#
# 3. Timeframes: Choose timeframes that match your trading style:
#    - 1min, 5min: Scalping and very short-term trades
#    - 15min, 30min: Intraday swing trading
#    - 1h, 2h: Longer swing trades
#    - 4h, 1d: Position trading
#
# 4. Execution Functions:
#    - close_above: Enter long when price closes above a level
#    - close_below: Enter short when price closes below a level  
#    - trailing_stop: Dynamic stop that trails profitable positions
#
# 5. Environment Safety:
#    - Always test new configurations in "paper" mode first
#    - Only switch to "live" when you're confident in your setup
#    - The system will warn you when using live mode
