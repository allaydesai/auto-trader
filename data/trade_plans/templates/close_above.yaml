# EXECUTION STRATEGY
# ==================

# Entry trigger configuration (REQUIRED)
# Defines the exact conditions for entering the trade
entry_function:
  # Entry mechanism: close_above function
  # Enters trade when candle CLOSES above threshold price
  # This avoids false breakouts from wicks/spikes
  function_type: "close_above"
  
  # Timeframe for price evaluation (REQUIRED)
  # Larger timeframes = fewer false signals, slower execution
  # Smaller timeframes = faster execution, more noise
  # Available: 1min, 5min, 15min, 30min, 1h, 2h, 4h, 1d
  # üí° RECOMMENDED: 15min (good balance of speed vs reliability)
  timeframe: "15min"  # üìù UPDATE THIS: Your preferred timeframe
  
  # Entry function parameters
  parameters:
    # Price threshold for entry trigger (REQUIRED)
    # Trade executes when {timeframe} candle closes ABOVE this level
    # üí° TIP: Often same as entry_level, or slightly higher for confirmation
    # Example: 180.50 (enters when 15min candle closes above $180.50)
    threshold: 0.00  # üìù UPDATE THIS: Your entry threshold

# Exit strategy configuration (REQUIRED)
# Defines how and when to exit the position
exit_function:
  # Exit mechanism: Standard stop-loss and take-profit
  # Monitors price continuously and exits at predefined levels
  # Simple, reliable, and widely used approach
  function_type: "stop_loss_take_profit"
  
  # Exit monitoring timeframe (REQUIRED)
  # Faster timeframes = quicker exit execution
  # üí° RECOMMENDED: 1min for rapid stop-loss execution
  timeframe: "1min"  # üìù UPDATE THIS: Your exit monitoring timeframe
  
  # Exit parameters (none needed for stop_loss_take_profit)
  # Stop loss and take profit levels are defined above
  parameters: {}
