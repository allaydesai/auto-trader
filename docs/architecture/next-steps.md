# Next Steps

Since this is a backend-only system for MVP:

1. **Immediate Development Tasks:**
   - Set up project structure with UV and enhanced CLI dependencies
   - Implement core models with pydantic including risk management models
   - Create enhanced risk management module with automated position sizing
   - Build interactive CLI wizard with real-time validation
   - Create IBKR client with circuit breaker
   - Build execution engine with the three functions
   - Add Discord notifications with risk metrics
   - Implement state persistence with portfolio tracking

2. **Testing Strategy:**
   - Set up pytest with asyncio support including CLI testing
   - Create comprehensive unit tests for risk management calculations
   - Create integration tests with paper account including CLI workflows
   - Build test fixtures for market data and risk scenarios
   - Test portfolio risk limit enforcement and validation

3. **Deployment Preparation:**
   - Create systemd service file (Linux)
   - Create Task Scheduler config (Windows)
   - Write deployment documentation

No frontend architecture needed for MVP - Discord serves as the user interface.
