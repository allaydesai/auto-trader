# Core UX Philosophy

## 1. **Clarity Through Constraints**
- **Principle**: Limited interfaces demand exceptional clarity in each interaction
- **Application**: Every Discord message, config file, and terminal output must be immediately understandable
- **Rationale**: With no visual UI to fall back on, text-based interfaces must be self-documenting

## 2. **Fail-Safe-by-Design**
- **Principle**: System should be nearly impossible to misconfigure dangerously
- **Application**: Config validation with clear error messages, simulation mode defaults, risk limit enforcement
- **Rationale**: Trading with real money requires bulletproof UX that prevents costly mistakes

## 3. **Progressive Disclosure**
- **Principle**: Show essential information first, details on demand
- **Application**: Discord notifications start with key facts, terminal logs offer varying verbosity levels
- **Rationale**: Trader needs quick decision-making information, not data overload
