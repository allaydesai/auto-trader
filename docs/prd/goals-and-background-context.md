# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Automate discretionary trading strategy execution with dynamic, time-based entry/exit logic to avoid institutional stop-hunting algorithms
- Achieve consistent trade execution within 1 second of signal generation across multiple timeframes (1 minute to 1 week)
- Eliminate emotional trading decisions and human execution delays through systematic automation
- Provide complete trade lifecycle visibility through real-time UI monitoring and Discord notifications
- Maintain comprehensive trade history for strategy analysis and refinement
- Support both live trading and simulation modes for testing and alert-only operation
- Deliver a working MVP within 4 weeks that handles the complete trade lifecycle from entry to exit

## Background Context
This PRD defines a personal automated trading system designed to address the fundamental challenges faced by retail traders in algorithm-dominated markets. Traditional retail trading platforms rely on simple price-level triggers that institutional algorithms easily exploit through stop-hunting strategies. By implementing time-based execution functions that trigger on candle closes rather than instantaneous price crosses, this system provides a more robust approach to trade execution that filters market noise and reduces vulnerability to algorithmic manipulation.

The system leverages established financial infrastructure (Interactive Brokers for execution, Financial Modeling Prep for market data, TA-lib for technical indicators) while maintaining complete user control over execution logic. As a single-user system built for the developer/trader, it eliminates multi-user complexity while focusing on modular architecture that supports custom execution functions and comprehensive trade management across multiple timeframes.
