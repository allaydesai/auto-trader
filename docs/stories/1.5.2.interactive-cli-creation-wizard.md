# Story 1.5.2: Interactive CLI Creation Wizard

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** trader,
**I want** an interactive CLI wizard to create trade plans with real-time validation,
**so that** I can efficiently create error-free plans with immediate feedback.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Core CLI Wizard Flow**
1: Implement command: `auto-trader create-plan` to launch interactive wizard
2: Prompt for each required field with current value display and validation
3: Show acceptable values for each field (e.g., "risk_category [small/normal/large]:")
4: Validate each input immediately and request correction if invalid
5: Calculate and display estimated position size during creation process using Epic 1.5.1 risk management
6: Allow plan preview before final save to YAML file

**Risk Integration**
7: Integrate with automated position sizing from Story 1.5.1 for real-time calculations
8: Display current portfolio risk and impact of new plan during creation
9: Block plan creation if it would exceed 10% portfolio risk limit
10: Show clear risk breakdown: individual trade risk + current portfolio risk
11: Provide risk-based suggestions for position size adjustments

**Enhanced User Experience**
12: Support CLI shortcuts: `auto-trader create-plan --symbol AAPL --entry 180.50`
13: Pre-populate fields from user configuration defaults
14: Allow modification of entered values before final confirmation
15: Provide clear error recovery for invalid inputs
16: Save completed plans to appropriate YAML files with proper formatting

**Validation Integration**

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.5.1 completion:
- Complete risk management system implemented with RiskManager, PositionSizer, and PortfolioTracker classes
- CLI integration established with rich formatting and risk display capabilities
- Position size calculation available via `calculate_position_size()` method
- Portfolio risk tracking with 10% limit enforcement in place
- Real-time risk calculations ready for wizard integration

### CLI Framework Integration
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Technology Stack Table + architecture/source-tree.md#CLI Interface]

**Existing CLI Infrastructure:**
- Click 8.1.7 framework for command-line interface with decorator-based commands
- Rich 13.7.0 for enhanced terminal output with colors, tables, and interactive prompts
- Modular CLI architecture in `src/auto_trader/cli/` with plan_commands.py (266 lines)
- Established patterns for error handling, logging, and user interaction

**Integration Points:**
- Extend plan_commands.py with new `create_plan_interactive()` command
- Use existing display_utils.py for Rich console formatting patterns
- Leverage error_utils.py for consistent error handling
- Integrate with existing logging_config.py for cli.log output

### Data Models and Validation Integration
[Source: architecture/data-models.md + architecture/components.md#ValidationEngine]

**TradePlan Model Requirements:**
- plan_id: str (format: SYMBOL_YYYYMMDD_NNN)
- symbol: str (1-10 uppercase chars, no special characters)
- entry_level: Decimal (positive, max 4 decimal places)
- stop_loss: Decimal (positive, max 4 decimal places, ≠ entry_level)
- take_profit: Decimal (positive, max 4 decimal places)
- risk_category: RiskCategory enum (small=1%, normal=2%, large=3%)
- entry_function: ExecutionFunction (close_above, close_below, trailing_stop)
- exit_function: ExecutionFunction

**Validation Engine Integration:**
- Use `validate_plan_data()` method for real-time field validation
- Leverage existing validation rules and error message formatting
- Integrate with ValidationResult and ValidationError models
- Follow established validation patterns from Story 1.2

### Risk Management Integration
[Source: architecture/components.md#risk_manager + Story 1.5.1 implementation]

**RiskManager Integration (Story 1.5.1):**
```python
# Available methods from Story 1.5.1 implementation
risk_manager.calculate_position_size(account_balance, risk_percent, entry_price, stop_price) -> PositionSizeResult
risk_manager.check_portfolio_risk_limit(new_trade_risk) -> RiskCheck
risk_manager.get_current_portfolio_risk() -> Decimal
risk_manager.validate_trade_plan(trade_plan, account_balance) -> RiskValidationResult
```

**Portfolio Risk Display:**
- Show current portfolio risk percentage before wizard starts
- Real-time calculation during entry/stop/risk input
- Clear risk breakdown: individual trade risk + current portfolio risk
- 10% portfolio limit enforcement with blocking and suggestions

### CLI Wizard Workflow Implementation
[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#CLI Trade Plan Creation Workflow]

**Sequential Wizard Flow:**
1. Display current portfolio status and risk capacity
2. Prompt for symbol with validation (1-10 uppercase chars)
3. Prompt for entry level with price validation (positive decimal)
4. Prompt for stop loss with validation (≠ entry, positive decimal)
5. Calculate and display stop distance percentage
6. Prompt for risk category with enum validation (small/normal/large)
7. Calculate and display position size + dollar risk in real-time
8. Check portfolio risk limit and show new total
9. Prompt for take profit with validation
10. Select execution function and timeframe
11. Show complete plan preview with Rich formatting
12. Confirm save and write to YAML file

### UX Guidelines Implementation
[Source: docs/ux-guidelines/core-ux-philosophy.md + safety-risk-management-ux.md]

**Fail-Safe by Design:**
- Validate all inputs immediately with clear error messages
- Default to simulation mode safety settings
- Block dangerous trades that exceed portfolio risk limits
- Provide clear recovery paths for validation errors

**Progressive Disclosure:**
- Start with essential portfolio context
- Show field hints and acceptable values
- Display calculated values as user progresses
- Reveal full plan preview before final confirmation

**Clarity Through Constraints:**
- Each prompt shows exactly what is expected
- Validation errors provide specific correction guidance
- Risk calculations displayed in clear, understandable format
- Status indicators use consistent iconography (✅❌⚠️)
