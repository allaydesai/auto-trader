### Completion Notes List

**Implementation Summary:**
- **EdgeCaseDetector**: Created comprehensive utility class for detecting and handling market edge cases including price gaps (>2%), limit moves (>10%), volume anomalies (>5x average), and data quality issues. Provides confidence adjustments and recommendations for each edge case type.

- **Enhanced CloseAboveFunction**: Added timeframe validation, distance constraints (min/max percentage from threshold), comprehensive parameter validation, and integrated edge case handling. All evaluations now respect timeframe boundaries and adjust confidence based on market conditions.

- **Enhanced CloseBelowFunction**: Added same timeframe validation and edge case handling as close_above, plus improved parameter validation for both EXIT (stop-loss) and ENTER_SHORT (breakdown) actions. Distance constraints prevent triggering on marginal or excessive price movements.

- **Enhanced TrailingStopFunction**: Added volatility-adjusted trailing using ATR calculation, fixed dollar amount trailing option, improved parameter validation (0.1%-50% bounds), and comprehensive edge case integration. Maintains proper state persistence for highest/lowest price tracking.

- **Comprehensive Testing**: Created 252 total tests including market scenario fixtures (trending, ranging, volatile), edge case specific tests, and integration tests. Test coverage includes all timeframes (1min, 5min, 15min, 1hour, 1day) and various market conditions.

**Key Enhancements:**
- All functions now validate timeframe consistency before evaluation
- Edge case detection prevents execution on invalid/dangerous market conditions
- Confidence scoring adjusts based on gaps, volume spikes, and volatility
