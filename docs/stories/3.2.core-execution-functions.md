# Story 3.2: Core Execution Functions

## Status
Ready for Development

## Story
**As a** trader,
**I want** three proven execution functions available,
**so that** I can implement my most common trading strategies.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. "close_above" function triggers when price closes above specified level
2. "close_below" function triggers when price closes below specified level  
3. "trailing_stop" function maintains stop distance from highest/lowest close
4. All functions respect timeframe parameter (only evaluate on specified bar size)
5. Functions handle edge cases (gaps, limit up/down, missing data)
6. Unit tests verify function behavior across market scenarios

### Testing Requirements

**Test Strategy** [Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]:
- Framework: pytest 8.3.0 with pytest-asyncio 0.24.0 for async tests
- Coverage: 80% minimum for core modules, 100% for risk-related functionality  
- Location: Tests in `tests/` subdirectory next to implementation files
- Mocking: unittest.mock + pytest fixtures for external dependencies

**Specific Testing Requirements**:
- Unit tests for all three execution functions with comprehensive parameter validation
- Market scenario tests covering trending, ranging, and volatile market conditions
- Timeframe-specific evaluation logic testing for all supported timeframes
- Edge case testing for gaps, limit up/down situations, and missing data scenarios
- Performance tests for high-frequency evaluation scenarios
- Mock market data scenarios using established fixtures from Story 3.1

### Technical Constraints

**Technology Stack** [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- Python 3.11.8 with asyncio for concurrent operations
- APScheduler 3.10.4 for time-based event scheduling  
- pydantic 2.9.0 for data validation and models
- loguru 0.7.2 for structured logging (NOT stdlib logging)

**Coding Standards** [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- Maximum file size: 500 lines, maximum function size: 50 lines
- Always use pydantic models, never raw dicts between functions
- Type hints required for all functions
- UTC timestamps everywhere, Decimal for monetary values
- Repository pattern for external data access

**Performance Requirements**:
- Function evaluation latency: <100ms for individual function calls
- Support for high-frequency scenarios without performance degradation  
- Memory-efficient parameter validation and confidence scoring
- Minimal overhead for timeframe-specific evaluation logic

### Integration Requirements
- Market data system integration from Story 2.2 implementation (BarData, MarketData models)
- Execution framework integration from Story 3.1 implementation (BarCloseDetector, ExecutionLogger)
- Integration with established ExecutionFunctionRegistry for plugin architecture
- State management integration for position tracking in trailing stop scenarios

### UX Requirements
**Core UX Philosophy** [Source: docs/ux/core-ux-philosophy.md]:
- **Clarity Through Constraints**: Execution function error messages and logging must be immediately understandable
- **Fail-Safe-by-Design**: Functions should be nearly impossible to misconfigure dangerously with comprehensive validation
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Show essential execution information first (action/confidence), details on demand via logging

**Error Recovery & Support** [Source: docs/ux/error-recovery-support.md]:
- Self-diagnostic capabilities for execution function validation and troubleshooting
- Clear error messages with recommended actions for parameter validation failures
- Debug information export including execution function evaluation history

**Monitoring & Observability** [Source: docs/ux/monitoring-observability-ux.md]:
- Execution function evaluation results must support real-time status dashboard display
- Function performance metrics for historical analysis and optimization
- Clear status indicators for function evaluation states and confidence levels

- Framework: pytest 8.3.0 with pytest-asyncio 0.24.0
- Coverage requirement: 80% minimum for execution functions
- Test categories: Unit tests (70%), Integration tests (20%), End-to-end tests (10%)

**Required Test Patterns**:
- AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert) for all tests
- Mock all external dependencies (market data, execution context)
- Fixtures for common test data in `conftest.py`
- Time-based testing using established patterns from Story 3.1

**Specific Testing Requirements**:
- Parameter validation tests for all three functions
