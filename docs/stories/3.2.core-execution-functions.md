# Story 3.2: Core Execution Functions

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** trader,
**I want** three proven execution functions available,
**so that** I can implement my most common trading strategies.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. "close_above" function triggers when price closes above specified level
2. "close_below" function triggers when price closes below specified level  
3. "trailing_stop" function maintains stop distance from highest/lowest close
4. All functions respect timeframe parameter (only evaluate on specified bar size)
5. Functions handle edge cases (gaps, limit up/down, missing data)
6. Unit tests verify function behavior across market scenarios

- Coverage: 80% minimum for core modules, 100% for risk-related functionality  
- Location: Tests in `tests/` subdirectory next to implementation files
- Mocking: unittest.mock + pytest fixtures for external dependencies

**Specific Testing Requirements**:
- Unit tests for all three execution functions with comprehensive parameter validation
- Market scenario tests covering trending, ranging, and volatile market conditions
- Timeframe-specific evaluation logic testing for all supported timeframes
- Edge case testing for gaps, limit up/down situations, and missing data scenarios
- Performance tests for high-frequency evaluation scenarios
- Mock market data scenarios using established fixtures from Story 3.1

### Technical Constraints

- APScheduler 3.10.4 for time-based event scheduling  
- pydantic 2.9.0 for data validation and models
- loguru 0.7.2 for structured logging (NOT stdlib logging)

**Coding Standards** [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- Maximum file size: 500 lines, maximum function size: 50 lines
- Always use pydantic models, never raw dicts between functions
- Type hints required for all functions
- UTC timestamps everywhere, Decimal for monetary values
- Repository pattern for external data access

**Performance Requirements**:
- Function evaluation latency: <100ms for individual function calls
- Support for high-frequency scenarios without performance degradation

### UX Requirements
**Core UX Philosophy** [Source: docs/ux/core-ux-philosophy.md]:
- **Clarity Through Constraints**: Execution function error messages and logging must be immediately understandable
- **Fail-Safe-by-Design**: Functions should be nearly impossible to misconfigure dangerously with comprehensive validation
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Show essential execution information first (action/confidence), details on demand via logging

**Error Recovery & Support** [Source: docs/ux/error-recovery-support.md]:
- Self-diagnostic capabilities for execution function validation and troubleshooting
- Clear error messages with recommended actions for parameter validation failures
- Debug information export including execution function evaluation history

**Monitoring & Observability** [Source: docs/ux/monitoring-observability-ux.md]:
- Execution function evaluation results must support real-time status dashboard display
- Function performance metrics for historical analysis and optimization
- Clear status indicators for function evaluation states and confidence levels

- AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert) for all tests
- Mock all external dependencies (market data, execution context)
- Fixtures for common test data in `conftest.py`
- Time-based testing using established patterns from Story 3.1

**Specific Testing Requirements**:

### Completion Notes List

**Implementation Summary:**
- **EdgeCaseDetector**: Created comprehensive utility class for detecting and handling market edge cases including price gaps (>2%), limit moves (>10%), volume anomalies (>5x average), and data quality issues. Provides confidence adjustments and recommendations for each edge case type.

- **Enhanced CloseAboveFunction**: Added timeframe validation, distance constraints (min/max percentage from threshold), comprehensive parameter validation, and integrated edge case handling. All evaluations now respect timeframe boundaries and adjust confidence based on market conditions.

- **Enhanced CloseBelowFunction**: Added same timeframe validation and edge case handling as close_above, plus improved parameter validation for both EXIT (stop-loss) and ENTER_SHORT (breakdown) actions. Distance constraints prevent triggering on marginal or excessive price movements.

- **Enhanced TrailingStopFunction**: Added volatility-adjusted trailing using ATR calculation, fixed dollar amount trailing option, improved parameter validation (0.1%-50% bounds), and comprehensive edge case integration. Maintains proper state persistence for highest/lowest price tracking.

- **Comprehensive Testing**: Created 252 total tests including market scenario fixtures (trending, ranging, volatile), edge case specific tests, and integration tests. Test coverage includes all timeframes (1min, 5min, 15min, 1hour, 1day) and various market conditions.

**Key Enhancements:**
- All functions now validate timeframe consistency before evaluation
- Edge case detection prevents execution on invalid/dangerous market conditions
- Confidence scoring adjusts based on gaps, volume spikes, and volatility
- Parameter validation prevents misconfiguration with clear error messages
- Comprehensive test coverage ensures reliability across market scenarios
