# Story 3.1: Execution Function Framework

## Status
Ready for Development

## Story
**As a** trader,
**I want** a framework for execution functions that trigger on candle closes,
**so that** I can avoid stop-hunting algorithms.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Function registry maps function names to implementations
2. Functions receive: current bar data, trade plan parameters, position state
3. Functions return: action (none, enter, exit) with confidence score
4. Bar close detection accurate within 1 second of actual close time
5. Multiple timeframes monitored simultaneously for same symbol
6. Execution decisions logged with reasoning for audit trail
