**Critical Version Requirements:**
- Python 3.11.8 exactly (IBKR API compatibility requirement)
- ib-async 1.0.0+ (modern async patterns, avoid deprecated ib_insync)
- Ensure all dependencies use UV package manager (never edit pyproject.toml directly)

### IBKR Client Architecture
[Source: architecture/components.md#ibkr_client]

**Core Component Design:**
```python
class IBKRClient:
    async def connect() -> None:
        """Establish IBKR connection with configuration validation."""
        
    async def disconnect() -> None:
        """Graceful disconnection with resource cleanup."""
        
    async def is_connected() -> bool:
        """Connection status for health checks."""
        
    async def get_account_type() -> str:
        """Detect paper vs live account for safety verification."""
        
    def get_connection_status() -> ConnectionStatus:
        """Current connection state for monitoring."""
```

**Circuit Breaker Integration:**
```python
class CircuitBreaker:
    def __init__(self, failure_threshold: int = 5, reset_timeout: int = 60):
        """Initialize with max retry attempts and backoff timing."""
        
    async def call_with_circuit_breaker(self, async_func: Callable):
        """Execute function with automatic retry and exponential backoff."""
        
    def record_failure(self) -> None:
        """Track connection failures for circuit breaker state."""
        
    def record_success(self) -> None:
        """Reset circuit breaker on successful connection."""
```

### Configuration Integration
[Source: architecture/components.md + CLAUDE.md Security Requirements]

**Settings Class Extension:**
```python
# In config.py
class Settings(BaseSettings):
    # Existing settings...
    
    # IBKR Configuration
    ibkr_host: str = Field(default="127.0.0.1", description="IBKR TWS/Gateway host")
    ibkr_port: int = Field(default=7497, description="IBKR TWS/Gateway port (7497=paper, 7496=live)")
    ibkr_client_id: int = Field(default=1, description="IBKR client identifier")
    ibkr_connect_timeout: int = Field(default=30, description="Connection timeout in seconds")
    ibkr_reconnect_attempts: int = Field(default=5, description="Maximum reconnection attempts")
    ibkr_graceful_shutdown: bool = Field(default=True, description="Close positions on shutdown")
    
    # Discord Integration (future)
    discord_webhook_url: Optional[str] = Field(default=None, description="Discord webhook for notifications")
    
    model_config = SettingsConfigDict(
        env_file=".env",
        env_file_encoding="utf-8", 
        case_sensitive=False
    )
```

**Environment Variables:**
```bash
# .env file additions
IBKR_HOST=127.0.0.1
IBKR_PORT=7497  # 7497 for paper, 7496 for live
IBKR_CLIENT_ID=1
IBKR_CONNECT_TIMEOUT=30
IBKR_RECONNECT_ATTEMPTS=5
IBKR_GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN=true
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...
```

### Connection Management Patterns
[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#Connection Recovery Workflow + docs/architecture/ib-async-docs.md]

**Connection State Management:**
- **DISCONNECTED:** Initial state or after connection loss
- **CONNECTING:** Connection attempt in progress  
- **CONNECTED:** Successfully connected and operational
- **RECONNECTING:** Automatic reconnection in progress
- **CIRCUIT_OPEN:** Circuit breaker activated, not attempting reconnection
- **SHUTDOWN:** Graceful shutdown initiated

**Exponential Backoff Strategy:**
```python
# Circuit breaker delay calculation
def calculate_backoff_delay(attempt: int, base_delay: int = 1) -> int:
    """Calculate exponential backoff delay: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s"""
    return min(base_delay * (2 ** attempt), 60)  # Max 60 seconds
```

**Connection Health Monitoring:**
```python
class ConnectionStatus(BaseModel):
    state: str  # connected, disconnected, reconnecting, etc.
    last_connected: Optional[datetime]
    reconnect_attempts: int
    account_type: Optional[str]  # "DU123456" (paper) or real account
    is_paper_account: bool
```

### Error Handling and Logging
[Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md + architecture/coding-standards.md#Critical Rules]

**Custom Exception Hierarchy:**
```python
class IBKRError(Exception):
    """Base exception for IBKR-related errors."""
    pass

class IBKRConnectionError(IBKRError):
    """Connection establishment or maintenance failed."""
    pass

class IBKRAuthenticationError(IBKRError):  
    """Authentication or authorization failed."""
    pass

class IBKRTimeoutError(IBKRError):
    """Operation timed out."""
    pass
```

**Structured Logging Requirements:**
```python
# Use loguru for all IBKR events
from loguru import logger

# Connection events
logger.info("IBKR connection established", 
           host=settings.ibkr_host, 
           port=settings.ibkr_port,
           account_type="paper" if is_paper else "live",
           connection_time=connection_duration)

# Error events  
logger.error("IBKR connection failed", 
            error=str(e), 
            attempt=retry_attempt,
            next_retry_in=backoff_delay)

# NEVER log sensitive data like account numbers or credentials
```

### Discord Notification Integration
[Source: architecture/components.md#discord_notifier]

**Connection Event Notifications:**
```python
# Future Discord integration patterns
async def notify_connection_event(event_type: str, details: dict):
    """Send IBKR connection events to Discord."""
    message_templates = {
        "connected": "🟢 **IBKR CONNECTED**\nAccount: {account_type}\nTime: {timestamp}",
        "disconnected": "🔴 **IBKR DISCONNECTED**\nReason: {reason}\nReconnecting...",
        "reconnect_failed": "❌ **RECONNECTION FAILED**\nAttempt {attempt}/{max_attempts}",
        "circuit_open": "⚠️ **CONNECTION CIRCUIT BREAKER ACTIVE**\nMax retries exceeded",
        "shutdown": "🛑 **SYSTEM SHUTDOWN**\nPositions: {position_action}"
    }
```

### Account Type Detection Logic
[Source: architecture/components.md#ibkr_client + CLAUDE.md Security Requirements]

**Paper Trading Detection:**
```python
async def detect_account_type(ib_client) -> Tuple[str, bool]:
    """
    Detect if connected to paper or live account.
    
    Returns:
        Tuple[account_id, is_paper_account]
    """
    account_summary = await ib_client.accountSummary()
    account_id = account_summary[0].account
    
    # Paper accounts typically start with "DU" 
    is_paper = account_id.startswith("DU")
    
    return account_id, is_paper
```

**Safety Logging Requirements:**
```python
if is_paper:
    logger.warning("⚠️ PAPER TRADING ACCOUNT DETECTED", 
                  account_id=account_id,
                  safety_mode="SIMULATION")
else:
    logger.critical("🔴 LIVE TRADING ACCOUNT DETECTED", 
                   account_id="***REDACTED***",  # Never log real account IDs
                   safety_mode="LIVE_TRADING")
```

### Graceful Shutdown Implementation
[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md + CLAUDE.md File Management]

**Shutdown Signal Handling:**
```python
import signal
import asyncio

class GracefulShutdown:
    def __init__(self, ibkr_client: IBKRClient):
        self.ibkr_client = ibkr_client
        self.shutdown_initiated = False
        
    def setup_signal_handlers(self):
        """Register SIGTERM and SIGINT handlers."""
        signal.signal(signal.SIGTERM, self._shutdown_handler)
        signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, self._shutdown_handler)
        
    def _shutdown_handler(self, signum, frame):
        """Handle shutdown signals."""
        if not self.shutdown_initiated:
            logger.info("Shutdown signal received", signal=signum)
            asyncio.create_task(self.graceful_shutdown())
            
    async def graceful_shutdown(self):
        """Perform graceful system shutdown."""
        self.shutdown_initiated = True
        
        if settings.ibkr_graceful_shutdown:
            await self._close_open_positions()
            
        await self.ibkr_client.disconnect()
        logger.info("Graceful shutdown completed")
```
