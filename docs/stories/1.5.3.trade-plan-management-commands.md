### Risk Management Integration
[Source: architecture/components.md#risk_manager + Story 1.5.1/1.5.2 implementation]

**Available Risk Management Components:**
```python
# From Story 1.5.1 implementation
risk_manager.calculate_position_size(account_balance, risk_percent, entry_price, stop_price) -> PositionSizeResult
risk_manager.check_portfolio_risk_limit(new_trade_risk) -> RiskCheck
risk_manager.get_current_portfolio_risk() -> Decimal
portfolio_tracker.get_portfolio_summary() -> Dict[str, Any]

# From Story 1.5.2 integration
wizard_utils.calculate_and_display_position_size() -> risk calculations with Rich formatting
risk_commands.portfolio_risk_summary() -> Rich formatted portfolio overview
```

**Portfolio Risk Display Requirements:**
- Current portfolio risk percentage (e.g., "6.7% of 10% limit")
- Remaining risk capacity for new trades
- Individual plan risk amounts and portfolio impact
- Color-coded risk level indicators (green/yellow/red)
- 10% portfolio limit enforcement with clear warnings

### File Structure and Command Locations
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#CLI Interface]

**Files to Modify/Enhance:**
- `src/auto_trader/cli/plan_commands.py` - Add new management commands (extend existing 397 lines)
- `src/auto_trader/cli/management_utils.py` - NEW: Plan management utility functions
- `src/auto_trader/cli/display_utils.py` - Enhance with new table formatting patterns
- `src/auto_trader/cli/tests/test_plan_commands.py` - Add management command tests
- `src/auto_trader/cli/tests/test_management_utils.py` - NEW: Management utilities test file

**Command Integration Pattern:**
```python
@cli.command("list-plans")
@click.option("--status", help="Filter by plan status")
@click.option("--sort-by", help="Sort by: risk, date, symbol")
@click.option("--verbose", is_flag=True, help="Show detailed information")
def list_plans_enhanced(status, sort_by, verbose):
    """Enhanced plan listing with risk management integration."""
```

**Archive Directory Structure:**
- `data/trade_plans/archive/YYYY/MM/` - Monthly archive organization
- `data/trade_plans/archive/completed/` - Completed plans archive
- `data/trade_plans/archive/cancelled/` - Cancelled plans archive

### Plan Modification and Backup System
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md + CLAUDE.md File Management]

**Backup Strategy:**
- Create timestamped backup before modification: `plan_id.backup.YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.yaml`
- Store backups in `data/trade_plans/backups/` directory
- Maintain backup retention policy (30 days default)
- Log all modifications with before/after values

**Field Update Validation:**
- Use existing TradePlan model validation for field updates
- Recalculate position size automatically after price field changes
- Validate portfolio risk impact after risk_category updates
- Ensure entry_level ≠ stop_loss validation for price updates

### UX Guidelines Implementation
[Source: docs/ux/core-ux-philosophy.md + docs/ux/terminal-interface-system-control.md]

**Core UX Principles Applied:**

**Clarity Through Constraints:**
- Every command output must be immediately understandable
- Plan status uses unified language: `awaiting_entry`, `position_open`, `completed`, `cancelled`, `error`
- Consistent plan_id format across all displays: `SYMBOL_YYYYMMDD_NNN`

**Fail-Safe by Design:**
- Portfolio risk limits enforced with clear warnings before dangerous operations
- Backup creation before any modification with confirmation prompts
- Validation errors with specific correction guidance
- Default to simulation mode safety settings

**Progressive Disclosure:**
- Default command output shows essential information first
- `--verbose` flag reveals additional details on demand
- Status-at-a-glance overview with drill-down capability

### Rich Console Formatting Patterns
[Source: architecture/components.md#CLI Framework + Story 1.5.2 implementation]

**Established Formatting Patterns:**
- Plan tables with color-coded status indicators using emoji: ✅❌⚠️
- Risk level color coding: green (safe), yellow (warning), red (danger)
- Portfolio risk progress bars and percentage displays
- Validation error formatting with specific correction guidance
- Rich panels for command results and summaries

**UX-Compliant Output Examples:**
```bash
$ auto-trader list-plans
📊 TRADE PLANS - 2025-08-22 14:30:15

🛡️  PORTFOLIO RISK: 6.2% / 10.0% limit (38% capacity remaining)

## Error Handling Improvements

### Remediation Date: 2025-08-25

### Completed By: James (Dev Agent)

### Issues Addressed

**CRITICAL ERROR HANDLING ISSUES (All Resolved):**
- ✅ **Overly Broad Exception Handling**: Replaced all `except Exception as e:` blocks with specific exception types
- ✅ **Inconsistent Error Propagation**: Standardized error propagation strategy across all management commands
- ✅ **Missing Backup Validation**: Added comprehensive backup verification before proceeding with plan modifications

### Technical Implementation

**Specific Exception Types Added:**
- `BackupVerificationError` - For backup integrity validation failures
- `PlanLoadingError` - For plan loading and file access issues
- `ValidationError` - For plan validation failures
- `FileSystemError` - For file system operations failures
- `RiskCalculationError` - For risk calculation failures

**Error Handling Strategy:**
1. **Specific Exception Catching**: All functions now catch specific exceptions (IOError, OSError, PermissionError, yaml.YAMLError, ValueError, TypeError) instead of broad Exception
2. **Consistent Error Messages**: Standardized error message format with clear action guidance
3. **Error Propagation**: Commands now raise Click exceptions with specific error messages and exit codes
4. **Backup Verification**: Added `verify_backup()` function with comprehensive integrity checks before plan modifications

**Backup Verification Features:**
- File existence and type validation
- Size comparison between original and backup
- YAML format validation
- Automatic backup cleanup on verification failure
- Comprehensive logging of verification steps

### Testing Enhancements

**New Error Handling Tests:**
- 17 new test cases for error handling scenarios
- Permission error simulation with proper cleanup
- Backup verification failure testing
- Plan update error propagation testing
- Exception hierarchy validation
- Mock-based error simulation for all error types

**Test Coverage:**
- All error paths covered with specific test cases
- Integration tests for complete error workflows
- Edge case testing for backup verification
- File system error simulation with proper mocking

### Quality Assurance Results

**Final Testing Results:**
- **Management Utils Tests**: 30/30 tests passing (100% pass rate)
- **Error Handling Tests**: 17/17 tests passing (100% pass rate)
- **No Regressions**: All existing functionality preserved
- **Code Quality**: Improved error handling throughout codebase

### Impact Assessment

**Benefits Achieved:**
1. **Robust Error Recovery**: System now handles specific error conditions gracefully
2. **Better User Experience**: Clear, actionable error messages instead of generic failures
3. **Data Safety**: Backup verification prevents data corruption during plan updates
4. **Debugging Capability**: Specific exception types enable precise error diagnosis
5. **Production Readiness**: Enhanced error handling suitable for production deployment

**Code Quality Improvements:**
- Eliminated all broad exception handlers
- Added comprehensive logging for all error conditions
- Implemented fail-safe mechanisms for destructive operations
- Enhanced test coverage for error scenarios
- Improved code maintainability through specific error types
